### Front-End Development

> What happens when we try to access a webpage?

Our `browser will send a request to the server` to the page that is hosted on internet.

Each and every website is stored on something called a **server** which is basically, a computer that is connected to internet and is able to receive request.

When the server receives the request, it will take all the files that makeup the website and send them back to the browser.

Eg: `index.html`, `script.js`, `style.css`, `image.jpg` etc

We say this as, the server sends the **response** to the browser

---

Here, the server sends the files with `.html`, `.css`, `.js` extensions

**These are precisely the three languages that browsers can understand.**

`That process of writing HTML, CSS and JavaScript code that the browser can understand is the process that we call` **Front-End Web Development**

### Static Website

**Website where files are simply sent from the browser to the browser as they are without making any transitions**


### Dynamic Website

Here, websites are dynamic.The website is dynamically assembled from different pieces of server like Database, Html, Css, Node.js, Python etc.

## The 3 Languages of FrontEnd

### HTML

* HTML is responsible for the content of the page.
* Like text, images, buttons etc
* Acts as Nouns. Example, saying that the `p` element is a paragraph

```html
<p></p>
```
means `paragraph`

### CSS

* CSS is responsible for the presentation of the content.
* Basically for styling and for laying out the elements on the webpage.
* Acts as Adjectives because, it basically describes the Noun.
    * Example, like this peice of CSS saying that the `paragraph text is red`
    * Red is the adjective describes the noun.

### JavaScript

* JavaScript is the actual programming language of the front-end.
* It allows us to add dynamic and interactive effects to our webpages.
* We can also use it to manipulate the content over the CSS to load data from servers
* To build entire frontend web application, called web applications.
* Acts as verbs
  * Saying `hide the paragraph`
  * We are actually doing something here.
